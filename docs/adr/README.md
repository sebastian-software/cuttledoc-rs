# Architecture decision records

ADRs capture decisions that materially constrain the implementation. Proposed ADRs must be validated by the relevant spike before being marked accepted.

| ADR                                                                    | Title                                              | Status   |

Status values: proposed, accepted, superseded, rejected.

During the current shaping phase, ADRs are working material and may be edited in place as research or spikes correct the decision. Once Phase 1 implementation starts, accepted ADRs are immutable; later changes must add a superseding ADR.
