# Compatibility matrix and quality gates

## Purpose

The migration is complete when users can replace Cuttledoc 2 with Cuttledoc 3 for supported workflows, not when an equivalent number of source files has been written in Rust.

Status values:

- **Required:** release-blocking compatibility.
- **Evaluate:** retain only after product/technical validation.
- **New:** intentional improvement rather than legacy parity.

## Platforms

| Platform                        | Local ASR | OpenAI | Rust CLI | Node API | Status                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------: | -----: | -------: | -------: | ---------------------------- |
| macOS Apple Silicon (macOS 26+) |       Yes |    Yes |      Yes |      Yes | Required                     |
| macOS Intel / macOS < 26        |        No |     No |       No |       No | Dropped in v3 (ADR-0007)     |
| Linux x64/arm64                 |        No |    Yes |      Yes |      Yes | Cloud-only required          |
| Windows x64/arm64               |        No |    Yes |      Yes |      Yes | Cloud-only required          |

Local ASR covers the selected Apple-local backends (Parakeet, Whisper, system Speech per the bakeoff). Cuttledoc 2 remains the product for Intel Macs and macOS releases before 26.

Unsupported local inference must be represented as capability absence. Installing the general product on Linux/Windows must not fail merely because Apple-only binaries are unavailable.

## Runtime and distribution

| Surface                  | Current baseline                                      | v3 target                           | Status   |

| Streaming results    |  Final segments (VAD-chunked) |       Final segments (chunks) |       Volatile + final |   Model-dependent | New, capability-gated (ADR-0008)   |

The Speech (system) column is a bakeoff candidate under ADR-0006/0007; its rows carry evaluation status, not legacy parity obligations.

Streaming contract tests reduce ordered, range-addressed replace/revoke updates into a transcript. They must cover volatile replacement, explicit revocation, finalization, overlap rejection for finalized ranges, and identical Rust/Node results (ADR-0008).

## Parakeet gates

| Behavior           | Baseline                                                    | v3 gate                                                                                     |

| Threshold          | 0.5 default                                                 | Match                                                                                       |

| Minimum speech     | 250 ms default                                              | Match                                                                                       |
| Result             | text, duration, segments in seconds                         | Equivalent text/segments with normalized domain time                                        |
| Warm speed         | Approximately 40× realtime on documented M1 Ultra benchmark | No more than 10% RTF regression on identical controlled hardware without accepted rationale |

Recognition gate:

- No statistically meaningful WER regression on the existing supported-language fixture set.
- Segment boundaries allow a documented tolerance because VAD and scheduling can vary; text association must remain correct.

## Whisper gates

| Behavior       | Baseline                                                    | v3 gate                                                                                     |

| Warm speed     | Approximately 14× realtime on documented M1 Ultra benchmark | No more than 10% RTF regression on identical controlled hardware without accepted rationale |

Recognition gate:

- No statistically meaningful WER regression on existing Whisper/FLEURS fixtures.
- Language detection must match the baseline for the controlled multilingual set or document an upstream model/runtime reason.

## Audio compatibility

| Capability                 | Baseline                             | v3 target                                                 | Status   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |

| Sample format              | signed 16-bit PCM converted to `f32` | Equivalent numerical conversion                           | Required |
| Speech normalization       | Cuttledoc utility                    | Golden-vector parity or benchmarked replacement           | Required |
| Custom FFmpeg path         | `FFMPEG_PATH`                        | Config/environment equivalent                             | Required |
| Managed binary             | npm postinstall download             | release/first-use strategy, never implicit broken install | Redesign |
| Temporary cleanup          | Explicit helper                      | RAII cleanup, failure-tested                              | Required |

Golden audio vectors should compare sample count, duration, channel fold-down, resampling tolerance, and normalized output.

## Model management

| Capability           | Baseline                       | v3 target                                | Status   |

| Existing cache reuse | Separate roots                 | Detect and migrate/reuse deliberately    | Required |
| Removal/verification | Limited                        | First-class API and CLI                  | New      |
| System-managed Speech assets | N/A                    | AssetInventory install/status surfaced through model API | New      |

## CLI compatibility

Release-blocking workflows:

- transcribe a single media path;
- choose backend and language;
- choose OpenAI model and key through environment;
- write output file;
- plain text and Markdown/JSON decisions documented;
- list and download models;
- benchmark against a reference;
- meaningful version and help output;
- nonzero exit with actionable error for invalid input.

Human-readable output may change. Machine-readable JSON receives a schema version and snapshot tests.

## Transcript enhancement

| Capability              | Baseline                | v3 decision                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Raw transcription       | Always available        | Required                                     |
| Correction mode         | Default CLI enhancement | Evaluate with compatibility/product decision |
| Markdown formatting     | Supported               | Evaluate; likely retain                      |
| Ollama                  | Supported               | Evaluate for Rust HTTP implementation        |
| OpenAI enhancement      | Supported               | Evaluate for Rust HTTP implementation        |
| Embedded GGUF           | `node-llama-cpp`        | Defer unless distribution cost is justified  |
| Chunking and statistics | Supported               | Preserve if enhancement ships                |

The v3 release must explicitly state whether enhancement parity is part of 3.0 or a later milestone. It must not delay a complete raw transcription product without a written decision.

## Artifact test matrix

Every release candidate must test the final artifacts rather than workspace links:

| Test                        |       macOS arm64 |          Linux x64 |        Windows x64 |

## Release evidence

A release candidate report must include:

- source commit and artifact digests;
- dependency and model manifest revisions;
- test matrix results;
- benchmark hardware/OS;
- cold/warm load and inference metrics;
- WER comparison;
- memory comparison;
- npm and CLI install sizes;
- known compatibility deviations and their acceptance decision.
