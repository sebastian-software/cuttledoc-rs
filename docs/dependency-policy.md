# Dependency policy and Phase 0 disposition inventory

**Status:** binding for Phase 0 and later.

**Evidence snapshot:** 2026-07-20.

**MLX route reaffirmed:** 2026-07-17.

**Authority:** [ADR-0005](adr/0005-third-party-dependency-policy.md).

This document turns ADR-0005 into a review gate. It applies to every runtime,
build-time, code-generation, and transitive dependency that can reach a
development build, a release artifact, or a stable public API. Models, managed
binaries, source archives, generated bindings, vendored code, and system
frameworks are reviewed in the same way; they are not loopholes around the
Cargo dependency graph.

## Rules

1. A technical spike does not grant production status. It records only the
   evidence needed to make a later decision.
2. A production dependency needs a row in the inventory with an explicit
   decision, an owner, a bounded role, a version/revision pin, a source and
   license review, and a replacement path.
3. `Reference only` means absent from `Cargo.toml`, build scripts, generated
   bindings, release artifacts, and stable APIs. It may inform a benchmark,
   fixture, or design note.
4. A repository-owned boundary is a small, owned adapter around an established
   upstream. The adapter owns the Rust-facing API, lifecycle, thread-affinity,
   error translation, and build/distribution contract. It does **not** vendor
   upstream by default.
5. Forking or vendoring needs a separate accepted ADR naming the code and
   license, maintenance owner, upstream/security process, CI matrix, expected
   divergence, and exit plan.
6. Additions or material upgrades must be reviewed before the manifest change.
   A lockfile update alone is not evidence of acceptance.

The evidence snapshot below is deliberately time-bound. Stars and recent
commits are useful signals, not acceptance criteria; governance, security
response, release discipline, CI, binary/transitive cost, and replaceability
remain part of each actual adoption review.

## Phase 0 dispositions

| Candidate | Decision | Reason and permitted scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) | Approved upstream foundation for a repository-owned candidate | Apple-maintained MIT upstream with releases (`v0.32.0` at the snapshot). It is the source of truth and the third first-class inference candidate. #6 builds a narrow owned C++ adapter directly over a pinned official MLX release/revision; MLX is not imported as a Rust crate and its types never cross the product API. |
| [mlx-c](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c) | Optional reference/control only | Official MIT C API, but **no GitHub releases**. It is not the product integration route. Use it only when a concrete interface or lifecycle question benefits from a secondary control; each use names an audited `mlx-c` commit and corresponding MLX revision. The current audited baseline is `fba4470b89073180056c9ea46c443051375f7399`, generated for MLX `0.31.2`. No floating `main`, documentation version, or unrecorded generated bindings are allowed. |
| Owned C++ adapter over MLX | Repository-owned boundary candidate | The intended MLX route: a small task-level C ABI directly over official MLX, pinned to a release/revision. It exposes no MLX types publicly and owns lifecycle, errors, thread-affinity, build, and distribution. Production adoption still requires spike and bakeoff evidence plus a dedicated accepted ADR. |
| [mlx-rs](https://github.com/oxiglade/mlx-rs) | Reference only | A useful community Rust binding and comparison source, but it is an additional wrapper/API and build path over MLX. It must not become a shortcut around ownership, update, or binary-size evidence. |
| [OminiX-MLX](https://github.com/OminiX-ai/OminiX-MLX) | Reference only | Young, task-specific MLX implementation. It can supply prior art and fixtures but is not an acceptable critical ASR, TTS, or LLM runtime dependency. |
| [mlx-audio](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-audio) | Reference only | The active v0.4.5 Python project supplies useful Qwen3-ASR, Canary, Nemotron, Parakeet, and Voxtral MLX model oracles, but it owns a broad task/runtime surface that Cuttledoc cannot delegate across its Rust boundary. It may run only in disposable benchmark environments and supply fixtures, shape mappings, and expected output. It is absent from product manifests and release artifacts. |
| [mlx-node](https://github.com/mlx-node/mlx-node) | Reference only | Node/C++ ownership and its own packaging model conflict with the Rust-owned core and thin Node boundary. It can inform npm artifact tests only. |
| [`objc2-core-ml`](https://docs.rs/objc2-core-ml/) via [objc2](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2) | Accepted production dependency, bounded | The versioned `objc2` framework crates provide the narrow Rust-to-Objective-C boundary needed by the CoreML spike (`objc2-core-ml` `0.3.2` at the snapshot). Acceptance is limited to an internal Apple adapter; no Objective-C type crosses the product API. #5 must still demonstrate required API coverage, ownership, thread behavior, deployment target, and binary impact. |
| [mistral.rs](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs) | Reference only | Active MIT project with releases, but its broad multimodal runtime and feature surface are disproportionate to the initial product boundary. Reconsider only in the separate Phase 5 LLM evaluation. |
| [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) | Reference only | Established Apache-2.0 upstream and useful Rust prior art. It is not selected for the initial ASR path or embedded LLM runtime; a Phase 5 proposal must re-evaluate its selected crates and transitive cost. |
| [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) | Repository-owned boundary candidate | Established MIT upstream with releases. The compatibility backend may use a small owned `-sys`/C ABI boundary, pinned to a release/commit and configured for CoreML/Metal in the artifact test matrix. No broad third-party Rust wrapper is pre-approved. |
| [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) | Accepted production dependency, bounded | Accepted only for the thin `cuttledoc-node` Node-API boundary and prebuilt-artifact packaging. It must not contain product orchestration or runtime ownership. The exact crate versions enter the allowlist with the future workspace change and are validated by ESM/CommonJS artifact tests. |
| FFmpeg/audio | Repository-owned boundary candidate | No FFmpeg crate or managed binary is accepted yet. Preserve broad codec parity through an owned, explicit system/release-managed FFmpeg boundary; record the exact binary/source, license configuration, digest, and update process. Pure-Rust decoders can be evaluated for narrow tasks but cannot claim broad media parity without fixtures. |

### Evidence notes

The snapshot observed current maintenance signals on 2026-07-16: MLX (27.6k
stars, 2.0k forks), Candle (20.7k, 1.7k), whisper.cpp (51.8k, 5.8k), napi-rs
(7.8k, 399), and mistral.rs (7.5k, 660) all had recent upstream activity.
Community candidates had materially smaller or newer footprints: mlx-rs (357
stars), OminiX-MLX (57; created 2026-01), and mlx-node (145; created 2025-11).
These observations explain the conservative dispositions; they do not replace
the gate.

## Required evidence for a proposed production pin

The proposal must state all of the following in its ADR or change request:

- upstream URL, selected package(s), exact version/commit, source digest, and
  license/provenance;
- current maintainer/governance, releases/tags, open security process, and
  supported macOS/Rust/Node/upstream CI;
- direct and transitive dependency list, binary/model size impact, build tools,
  generated code, and release artifacts;
- Apple Silicon runtime evidence: cold/warm load, first-result latency,
  throughput, peak memory, energy procedure, cleanup, cancellation, and
  thread-affinity behavior;
- fixture/quality evidence and a fallback or replacement boundary; and
- a named Cuttledoc owner and upgrade/rollback plan.

For the owned MLX adapter, the proposal records the immutable official MLX
release/revision, source digest, build configuration, generated artifacts, and
compatibility test matrix. If `mlx-c` is used as an optional control, it also
records its immutable commit and the MLX revision/version it was generated
against. Neither source nor generated bindings are fetched implicitly during a
release build.

## Automated gates

`scripts/check-dependency-policy.sh` is the immediate policy gate. Once a
Cargo workspace exists it rejects direct dependencies missing from
`docs/dependency-allowlist.txt` and rejects the projects currently classified
as reference-only. `.github/workflows/dependency-policy.yml` then runs
`cargo-deny` for advisories, licenses, sources, and duplicate versions. A
manifest addition must update the inventory and allowlist in the same reviewed
change; the CI check intentionally makes an unreviewed dependency fail.

The `cargo-deny` configuration is a baseline, not a waiver mechanism. Any
exception is time-bounded, documented beside the inventory entry, and removed
when the upstream issue is resolved or the dependency leaves the graph.
