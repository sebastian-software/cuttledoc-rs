- Passage selector and digest: `synthetic-en-dialogue` in
  `benchmarks/fixtures/synthetic-roundtrip-selection.json`

The repository-authored passage is materialized without an additional
spoken-text transform. One generated voice reads the exchange, so this is a
dialogue-text and punctuation control rather than a two-speaker or
diarization fixture.

The lossless generated source is mono 24 kHz float PCM with SHA-256
`16861551367714425a050ccef68328e040104196f1935248429823bc2d1cec8a`.
It was quantized to the PCM16 WAV with SHA-256
`dd1ab38c86dc4fece4830d0196f24f1dd3378b6f038f81dd5816f93570634e58`
before the checked-in Ogg Opus encode.

Qwen reads the reference correctly through “avoid chasing every sentence”,
then repeatedly synthesizes “What happens if someone turns away while
speaking?” until the fixed 1,200-token limit. The last 32 of 134 reference
words are absent. Four receivers therefore report roughly 24–25% WER;
Whisper transcribes the audible repeated phrase and exceeds 200% WER. This is
a reproducible failed generation control, not a quality exemplar or a passed
dialogue cell.
