The lossless generated source is mono 24 kHz float PCM with SHA-256
`d41af4cabc9a13091a2c0e04cf08d502042c667d035feb089f4c3cfec93f953b`. It was quantized to the PCM16 WAV with SHA-256
`9eec7dfda0f554606c44a66dcf22e0d01f6a75e287f037d532995d389ae067f1` before the checked-in Ogg Opus encode.

All five receivers agree that the dialogue stops after “Jonas sourit”. Qwen then repeats unintelligible material until the fixed token limit and omits the remaining dialogue. Listening review remains required before treating this recording as
a voice-quality exemplar.
