- Passage selector and digest: `synthetic-de-dialogue` in
  `benchmarks/fixtures/synthetic-roundtrip-selection.json`

The repository-authored passage is materialized without an additional
spoken-text transform. One generated voice reads the full exchange, so this is
a dialogue-text and punctuation control rather than a two-speaker or
diarization fixture.

The lossless generated source is mono 24 kHz float PCM with SHA-256
`6519ca5543caf434b48e90970eed0c3e97aa32a14efae76c069b124a3bf5608e`.
It was quantized to the PCM16 WAV with SHA-256

before the checked-in Ogg Opus encode. The codec conversion is a format and
compression change; it does not intentionally alter the spoken content.

Whisper, direct Qwen3-ASR, and Apple each make one word edit; direct Voxtral
makes two. Parakeet makes seven receiver-specific edits, including “Bagmara”,
“Nine”, and an omitted speaker attribution. The other four receivers recover
those locations, so the shared evidence does not indicate a Qwen content
omission. This recording passes the dialogue lexical gate; listening review is
still required before treating it as a quality exemplar.
